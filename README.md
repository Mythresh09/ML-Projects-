The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model to predict the selling price of second-hand cars, which is crucial for optimizing revenue in India's rapidly growing used car market. The dataset included features such as car brand, model, manufacturing year, distance traveled, fuel type, and car age.

To solve this, we followed a structured approach:

Data Preprocessing – Loaded the dataset, handled missing values, and performed feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Conducted univariate analysis (distribution of features) and multivariate analysis (correlations between variables).

Feature Selection – Identified key variables influencing car prices, such as car age, distance traveled, and brand.

Model Selection & Training – Experimented with various regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to find the best-performing model.

Model Evaluation – Compared models using metrics like RMSE and R² score, ensuring generalizability on test data.

Feature Importance Analysis – Used techniques like SHAP values and feature coefficients to understand the most significant factors impacting car prices.
